<p>Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.</p>

<h2 id="makesbenhurlooklikeanepic">Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic!</h2>

<p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. It's only a model. She looks like one. Burn her anyway! I am your king.</p>

<ul>
<li>But you are dressed as one…</li>
<li>A newt?</li>
<li>Well, I got better.</li>
<li>She looks like one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="letemeatcake">Let 'Em Eat Cake</h3>

<p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll <strong>have more fun</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bravely bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot.
  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.
  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.
  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.
  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp.
  Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken.
  To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away.
  And all his limbs hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin.
  His head smashed in and his heart cut out.
  And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="goodgrief">Good Grief!</h4>

<p>That's why you <em>always leave a note</em>! I'm a monster. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Army had half a day.</p>

<ol>
<li>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot">Camelot</a>!</li>
<li>Bloody Peasant!</li>
<li>Where'd you get the coconuts?</li>

<p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>

<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>

<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>

<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Red Five standing by. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. You mean it controls your actions? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Ye-ha!</p>

<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks <em>and</em> blows. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>

<p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does <em>that</em> do me?</p>

<p>I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode <em>ever.</em> Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>

<p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Ahoy hoy?</p>
